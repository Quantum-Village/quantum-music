# Qubit Crusher

This is the repo for QubitCrusher - a distortion effect based on the (in)famous `bitcrusher` distortion effect, the source for which can be found here: [bitcrusher demo download](https://www.korg.com/us/support/download/others/0/832/4743/).

We have taken this effect and made it _QUANTUM_! You can download it ready to use RIGHT NOW on a KORG Nu:tekt NTS-1 here: [qubitcrusher.ntkdigunit](./qubitcrusher.ntkdigunit)

## Wait, 'made it quantum' how?

The bitcrusher effect relies on the device 'skipping' a given number of samples per 64 sample block. The more samples, the more distorted it sounds.
