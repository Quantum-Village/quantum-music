# Making Music Quantum
A public repository for all of our quantum music activities. There are three ways we think music can be made quantum:

* Quantum algorithms generating sounds/synthesis settings
* Quantum algorithms generating notes/rhythms to play
* Quantum algorithms as effects/modulation

## What is this?

This is a collection of methods with code and compiled downloads for musicians to use to explore adding quantum weirdness to their music! 

Currently this repo includes:

* [qubitcrusher](./qubitcrusher) - a quantum based mod effect for the NTS-1 and other Logue-sdk synths from KORG.
* [Quantum Midi](./q-midi/) - a quantum midi firmware for a Pi Pico that allows the user to do two things:
  1. Generate notes from the current note played by passing that note through a quantum simulation
  1. Generate quantum FM synth patches from a simulation, prepared for a Yamaha Reface DX

TODO finish...
